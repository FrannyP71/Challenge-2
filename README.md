# Challenge-2
My portfolio, showing potential through work samples so my work can be reviewed to assess my candidacy for an open position. You can see my portfolio with links about me, my work, and contact info. Here you can also review my HTML, CSS, and eventually Javascript skills. I used the bootcamp lesson plan and tuturing sessions as well as YouTube tutorials to make this site come to life.
